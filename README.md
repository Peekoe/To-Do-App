# ToDo App

Note: This app works 100% as intended locally, but it seems like Netlify wants me to rewrite the whole backend in order to work with the deployment. I might try Heroku, or if anyone knows how to fix this issue, I would appreciate it.
 
# Technologies Used

* React
* MongoDB
* ExpressJS
* NodeJS
* Tailwind for CSS

1. Fork or Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) or `yarn` installed 
3. `npm install` in the root directory (outside of the `public` and `src`) and the `backend` folder to install dependencies needed for testing the app
4. `npm start` in the root directory to start the front end
5. Open another terminal and run `node server.js` or `npx nodemon server.js` in the `backend` folder to start the backend server
